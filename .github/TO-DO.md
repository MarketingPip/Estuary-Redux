# To-Do

> Tasks needed to be done for this project!

Hello, and thank you for taking your time to look at the tasks that this project needs help with! <a href="https://github.com/MarketingPipeline/Estuary-Redux"><b>Estuary Redux</b></a> is a refreshed version of the <a href="https://github.com/MarketingPipeline/Estuary-Redux"><b>Estuary</b></a> design framework.

Which is also a work in progress. To make maintaining both of these projects, the <a href="https://github.com/MarketingPipeline/Estuary-Redux"><b>Estuary Redux</b></a> design framework itself should ideally be worked on first. You can find more info about the Estuary design framework here. 

Once progress is improved on <a href="https://github.com/MarketingPipeline/Estuary-Redux"><b>Estuary Redux</b></a>, documentation and more can hopefully start to begin for this project.
