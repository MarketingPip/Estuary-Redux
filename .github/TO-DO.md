# To-Do

> Tasks needed to be done for this project!

Hello, and thank you for taking your time to look at the tasks that this project needs help with! <b>Estuary Redux</b> is a refreshed version of the <b>Estuary</b> design framework.

Which is also a work in progress. To make maintaining both of these projects, the Estuary design framework itself should ideally be worked on first. You can find more info about the Estuary design framework here. 

Once progress is improved on <b>Estuary</b>, documentation and more can hopefully start to begin for this project.
